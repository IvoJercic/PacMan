# PacMan

In this project, it was necessary to implement algorithms that would allow PacMan to collect all the cookies inside the labyrinth.
On the other hand, there are ghosts in the labyrinth trying to prevent PacMan from doing so.

It is possible to run a simulation on 3 different labyrinth.
Also, for each labyrinth it is possible to define the number of ghosts which are trying to prevent PacMan. You can choose among three  options:0,1 or 2 ghosts.

Search algorithms used in this project are: Search by patch ID, Search by Attendance, Greedy algorithm, A* (A-star) and Breadth-first search.

To run this simulation correctly, you need to install the NetLogo environment version 3.5.1.
It is extremely important that you install this version, otherwise you may expect errors due to some changes made to the newer versions.
